`Later on`

- [ ] configure different type of project earned money. (maybe input boxes for each parameter)
- [ ] add "hire developer" button somewhere
- [ ] add "bug alert" for each project. this error alert will run in a probabilistic way
- [ ] add "debug" button to project table. if there is no bug in the project this button will be disabled
- [ ] each "bug alert" costs you
- [ ] every debug will help you recover your lost money
- [ ] add "update project" button to the table. this update button includes only new features not bug fixes.
- [ ] add "remove project" button to the table. this remove button stops the money you earn from that project.
